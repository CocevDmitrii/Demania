Example of the program: Input:

import math

diagonal = input("What diagonal do you want to see?")

term = input("What term do you want to see?")

product= term
for i in range (term + (diagonal - 2)):

    product = ((product * (i+1))/(math.factorial(diagonal - 1)))

print(product)


|| Grade of marks:

Pay attention to the principles of OOP, try to break the program into logical classes. Solutions in which all the program code is in one class will be low rated. Demonstrate your ability to work with different syntactic constructions, do not forget about exceptional situations in which the execution of the program is impossible due to incorrect input data.
